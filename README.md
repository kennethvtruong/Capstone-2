# Capstone-2
This project was created using data from UCI's Machine Learning Database. I used this to create a collaborative recommendation system to recommend restaurants based on other user profiles.
I used matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization as well as RandomForestClassification, SelectFromModel, and GridSearchCV to also create a predictive model on restaurant ratings.
The latest file is labeled Capstone 2 and the final report is labeled as Milestone Report 2. and slide decks can be found as pdf's in the page.
